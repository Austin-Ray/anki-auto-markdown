## Convert-all to Markdown button

Converts all fields in note to Markdown. Can't really be a toggle because some fields may already be converted. So convert-all-to and convert-all-from Markdown buttons would be required.

## Markdown Mode indication

When in manual mode, onFocusGained indicate that the field has been generated and shouldn't be edited.

## Field should be auto markdown by convention

Allow setting of custom field name suffix, e.g. "_mkd_", to indicate that the field should be auto markdown.
