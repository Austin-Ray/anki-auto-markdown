# Auto Markdown

Source for the [Auto Markdown](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1030875226) Anki add-on.

## To-do

### Better implementation of fields.py

Current code is incompatible with other add-ons. 

## Possible Features

### Convert-all to Markdown button

Have convert-all-to and convert-all-from buttons to allow easier adoptation and prevent lock-in.

### Field should be auto markdown by convention

Allow setting of custom field name suffix, e.g. "_mkd_", to indicate that the field should be auto markdown.
